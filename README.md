# Blog Application

This is a **Blog Application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) with state management handled by **Redux Toolkit**. The application features user authentication,
CRUD functionalities, and allows multiple users to post articles and news with images. Styling is powered by **Tailwind CSS**.

The backend uses **bcrypt** for hashing passwords and **JWT** for secure authentication. Users can create, edit, delete, and view posts,
making it a dynamic platform for sharing content.
